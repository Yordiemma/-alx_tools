    <h4>For the Dough</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>All-purpose flour - 2 cups</li>
      <li>Instant yeast - 1 tsp</li>
      <li>Salt - 1/2 tbsp</li>
      <li>Olive oil - 2 tablespoons</li>
      <li>Warm water - 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup</li>
      <li>Raisins - 1/4 cup</li>
      <li>Black sesame seeds - 1 tsp</li>
      <li>Cardamom powder - 1 tsp</li>
      <li>Sugar - 3 tbsp</li>
      <li>Milk - 3 tablespoons (for brushing on top, optional)</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, instant yeast, salt, cardamom powder, and sugar.</li>
      <li>Add the olive oil and mix it into the dry ingredients until it is well incorporated.</li>
      <li>Gradually add the warm water, a little at a time, and knead the dough until it is smooth and elastic. You may not need to use all the water, so add it slowly.</li>
      <li>Once the dough is formed, add the raisins and black sesame seeds, and knead them into the dough until evenly distributed.</li>
      <li>Shape the dough into a ball and place it in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover it with a clean cloth and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
      <li>After the dough has risen, punch it down to release the air. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and shape it into a round loaf.</li>
      <li>Place the shaped dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. If desired, brush the top of the dough with milk to give it a nice golden color when baked.</li>
      <li>Use a sharp knife to score the top of the dough with a cross or any pattern you like. This will allow the bread to expand while baking.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.</li>
      <li>Remove from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
